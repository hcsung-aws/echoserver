# Linux Build Issues in C++ Code

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several issues that could prevent successful building on Linux:

## 1. Memory Management Issues

### In `session.cpp`:
- Lines 12-13: Uses Windows-style `calloc` without including the required `<stdlib.h>` or `<cstdlib>` header.
```cpp
recv_buffer_ = (char*)calloc(sizeof(char), max_recv_buffer_size);
```
- Line 16: Uses `free` without proper header inclusion.
```cpp
free(recv_buffer_);
```
- Lines 30-38: Similar memory allocation issues with `calloc` and `free`.

### Fix:
- Add `#include <cstdlib>` at the top of the file for proper memory allocation function declarations.

## 2. String and Memory Operations

### In `session.cpp`:
- Lines 36-37: Uses `memcpy` without including the required `<string.h>` or `<cstring>` header.
```cpp
memcpy(swap_buffer, recv_buffer_ + recv_offset_, recv_size_);
memcpy(recv_buffer_, swap_buffer, recv_size_);
```
- Line 41: Another `memcpy` usage.

### Fix:
- Add `#include <cstring>` at the top of the file for `memcpy` and other memory operations.

## 3. Platform-Specific Code

- The code uses `#pragma once` directives which, while widely supported, are not part of the C++ standard. This might cause issues with some Linux compilers.

## 4. CMakeLists.txt Issues

- The CMake file correctly sets up the project, but there might be issues with include paths if the code depends on Windows-specific headers not available on Linux.

## 5. Missing Implementation

- Several functions are commented out in the `.cpp` files but declared in the `.h` files. This could lead to unresolved symbol errors.

## 6. Potential Type Issues

- The code might have assumptions about type sizes or endianness that differ between Windows and Linux.

## Required Fixes

1. Add missing standard headers:
   ```cpp
   #include <cstdlib>  // For calloc, free
   #include <cstring>  // For memcpy
   ```

2. Ensure all functions are properly implemented for Linux.

3. Replace any Windows-specific APIs with cross-platform equivalents.

4. Consider using more C++ idiomatic memory management like `std::vector` or `std::unique_ptr` instead of raw `calloc`/`free`.

5. Make sure all file paths in includes use forward slashes for Linux compatibility.
